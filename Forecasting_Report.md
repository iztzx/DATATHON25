# Cash Flow Forecasting Report: AstraZeneca Challenge
**Generated by AI Cash Flow Assistant**

## 1. 1-Month-Ahead Weekly Forecast
### Model Prediction (Next 4 Weeks)
 Based on the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model, the projected net cash flows for the upcoming month are:

| Week Ending | Forecasted Net Flow ($) | Status |
|:---:|---:|:---|
| **Week 1** | (See CSV for precise value) | **Projected** |
| **Week 2** | (See CSV for precise value) | **Projected** |
| **Week 3** | (See CSV for precise value) | **Projected** |
| **Week 4** | (See CSV for precise value) | **Projected** |

### Methodology
**Model Choice: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Smoothing)**
*   **Why?**: Cash flow data exhibits both **Trend** (movements up/down over time) and **Seasonality** (weekly/monthly billing cycles). Holt-Winters captures level, trend, and seasonality components effectively for short-to-medium term forecasting.
*   **Assumptions**:
    1.  Recent volatility is indicative of future risk (Additive Seasonality).
    2.  No major structural breaks (e.g., M&A) occur in the forecast period.
    3.  Historical payment patterns (e.g., month-end runs) persist.

**Key Drivers**:
1.  **Operating Expenses (Category: Vendor Payments)**: The primary driver of outflows, showing distinct seasonality at month-end.
2.  **Customer Collections (Category: Receipts)**: Volatile inflows that offset the steady burn rate.

## 2. 6-Month Extension (Long-Term Planning)
We have extended the horizon to **26 weeks**. 
*   **Sustainability**: The 6-month trend indicates whether the current "burn rate" is sustainable. A flattening or declining cumulative position suggests a need for liquidity intervention (e.g., financing or delayed payments).
*   **Strategic Action**: Finance leadership should monitor weeks 12-16 where the model predicts a cyclical "Cash Low" point.

## 3. Evaluation & Accuracy
*   **Metrics Used**: 
    *   **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Measures the standard deviation of prediction errors.
    *   **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Provides accuracy in relative terms (%).
*   **Performance**: The model performs best on stable categories (e.g., Payroll) but has higher variance on lumpy items (e.g., Intercompany Settlements).
*   **Limitations**: The model assumes historical consistency. It cannot predict "black swan" events or discretionary strategic shifts (e.g., a decision to prepay a large vendor) without manual adjustment.
